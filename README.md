# non-eculidean-engine
This engine defies the laws of physics, in an non-Euclidean way. ( read the readme.md file)
 To run this program , extract the contents of the .zip file, open the folder. Then find the application named "Non Euclidean" and double click it.
 The controls are as follows:
 WASD to move, Mouse to move around, Alt+Enter to open the demo in full screen, Esc to close it.
 On the other note, i really do need to stop making new engine EVERY SINGLE TIME BRO
